    neighborhood size (NS)

Description: sGD provides spatially explicit estimates of genetic diversity
    indices and Wright's neighborhood size in continuous populations isolated
    by distance or resistance as described in Shirk & Cushman 2014. Inputs
    include a set of spatially referenced codominant marker genotypes, a matrix
    of pairwise distances between all sampled individuals (either in Euclidean
    units or as effective distances quantified by methods such as
    least-cost-path or circuit theory), and several parameters, including the
    minimum neighborhood size and the neighborhood radius (specified in
    Euclidean or effective distances). sGD defines a local neighborhood extent
    (based on a user-specified radius) around each sample location, and then
    calculates genetic diversity indices and/or Wright's neighborhood size (a
    local measure of effective population size that accounts for the continuous
    structure of populations isolated by distance). Requires the NeEstimator
    program (version 2.01) available at
    http://molecularfisherieslaboratory.com.au/neestimator-software.
